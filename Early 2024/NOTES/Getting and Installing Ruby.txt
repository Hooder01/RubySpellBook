No matter how wonderful Ruby is, there isn't much you can do with it if it is not installed on your computer system.
In this chapter we will cover the download and installation of Ruby on Linux, UNIX and Windows.




Ruby is itself written in the C programming language. 
This means that either a binary distribution for your chosen operating system and hardware platform needs to be installed, or the Ruby sources need to be downloaded and compiled on your target system.
Whilst compiling Ruby yourself might be fun, it usually makes more sense to simply download and install one of the many pre-built Ruby packages rather than attempt to build your own. 
In this chapter we will cover installing pre-built Ruby packages on each platform.
