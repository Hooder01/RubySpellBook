"prints" and "puts" are both used to print any form of text to the console however

"puts" or "put" will create a new line in the console while print uses the same line

examples:

put "hello" 
print "world"

console result:

hello 
world

---

print "hello world"
put "I'm name" 

console result:

hello world I'm name

---

a way to get around this:

put "hello world" (will create new line)

print "I'm name"
